You need to create a AppSettings.json in the root of the project. Right click on ChatNeuralNetworkTrainer and add new item, json, and name it AppSettings.json.
This file needs to contain the database url. You also need to right click on the project (again ChatNeuralNetworkTrainer) and select manage user secrets.
This file needs to be identical to the AppSettings.json.
AppSettings has to be set to "Embedded resource" and Always copy

I don't know why, don't ask
